## Welcome to my GitHub repository!

As a beginner, I am excited to share with you some of the projects I have been working on. Although I am not a professional developer, I am passionate about programming and I am dedicated to improving my skills.

In this repository, you will find various projects that I have completed, ranging from small scripts to more complex applications. My goal is to learn as much as I can from each project and to improve upon my skills with each new project that I complete.

Please keep in mind that these projects are works in progress and are subject to change. I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have, as I am always looking for ways to improve.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my GitHub repository. I hope you find something here that interests you!
